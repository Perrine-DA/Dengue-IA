DataDriven Dengue AI competition

The following code aims at answering to the prediction of Dengue's cases in San Juan and Iquitos in Peru.
More information about the competition can be found here : [Data_Driven_Dengue_IA](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/)https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/

The following files are the data useful for the project :
- Submission Format : The format that the submission to the competition must be in.
- Test Data Features	: The features for the testing dataset
- Training Data Features : The features for the training dataset.
- Training Data Labels : The number of dengue cases for each row in the training dataset.

The file Submission PDA - DengAI - Predicting Disease Spread.ipynb is my code proposal.
